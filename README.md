"What to eat tonight!?"
That's a good and common question distubing us everyday for three meals(normally).

This App provides a QUICK ANSWER to your question!

You can either let the app "Randomly" pick a recommended retaurant from Visited Restaurants or All Restaurants.
Of course, accept it and give it a try, or decline it with factors to optimize the next picking is up to you!
For example, the distance or price issue, or even the type disliked, will be consider into the next random picking.

We offer you the BEST choice you never knew about it.

This version hasn't completed yet. Only for prototype demonstration in HackUST 2016.
